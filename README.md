# Play with Computer Vision

This Repo is a collection of some classic computer vision algorithms I studied in computer vision nanodegree from Udacity introduced in Jupyter Notebooks for simplicity.

Repo contains face detection using Haar Cascade, and using Harris Detector for corner Detections.


## Edge Detection section
Edge Detection folder contains notebooks for the following topics:

1- Using Histogram of Gradients (HOG) for Edge Detection

2- Using Hough transform for detecting lines on Ede detected image

3- Using Canny Edge detector

4- Fourier Transform for detecting High frequencies (edges) and low frequencies (smooth colors) in images

5- using Gaussian Blur as low frequency noise filter

6- Detecting contours through binary images and Canny edge detector
